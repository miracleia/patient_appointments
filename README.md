The No-Show Medical Appointments dataset contains information from 110,527 medical appointments made by 62,299 patients in Brazilian healthcare facilities. My analysis attempts to determine the strength and probability of various factors in determining whether or not Brazilian patients turn up for their doctor's appointments. 
Due to confidentiality requirements, the dataset only includes anonymous numeric identifiers.

> My analysis sought to find the features that increase the likelihood of patients who miss their medical appointments, the effect of multiple disabilities on the proportion of handicapped patients who meet their appointments, and the effectiveness of efforts such as SMS reminders and the Bolsa Familia social welfare coverage in increasing the proportion of patients who meet their medical appointments. Through the sectioned analyses made in the attached Jupyter notebook, the data points to these conclusions:

* Patients appear more likely to show up for their doctor's appointments as they grow older, until they reach the age of 100.
* Hypertensive patients are more likely to show up for their appointments than diabetic ones. However, those with both hypertension and diabetes are highly unlikely to miss a doctor's appointment.
* There is a strong correlation between the residence of patients and the frequency of unmet appointments. With data on the neighbourhoods, this correlation can be explored further.
* Provisions such as social welfare healthcare scholarships and SMS reminders do not have any significant effect on the likelihood of patients to show up for their appointments.
* Disabled patients with multiple handicaps are less likely to show up for appointments with increasing number of diabilities.
* Alcoholism and Gender do not have any significant effect on the likelihood of patients to show up for their appointments.
