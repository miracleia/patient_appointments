# patient_appointments
The No-Show Medical Appointments dataset contains information from 110,527 medical appointments made by 62,299 patients in Brazilian healthcare facilities. My analysis attempts to determine the strength and probability of various factors in determining whether or not Brazilian patients turn up for their doctor's appointments. 
Due to confidentiality requirements, the dataset only includes anonymous numeric identifiers.
